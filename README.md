# Parallelizing Gradient Calculations in t-SNE
By: Jason Zhang, Vy Nguyen

## Summary
Our objective is to parallelize the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) method for non-linear dimensionality reduction. Sequential implementations have seen speedups in algorithmic complexity from nearest-neighbors and Barnes-Hut approximations [1], and in this work we seek to exploit parallelism to further accelerate the gradient calculations in t-SNE.
